The feature I added in was a login activity which allows 3 users to access (David, Test and Admin). If the user types the correct username and password, they will be moved to the main activity page. On the activity, their name will also be dipslayed to notify which user they are. If they enter the account information incorrectly, a Toast will be displayed to notify their incorrect input.
